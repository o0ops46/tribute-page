        <h3>The Child</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Winston Churchill was born into the privileged world of the British
          aristocracy on November 30, 1874. His father, Lord Randolph Churchill,
          was a younger son of the 7th Duke of Marlborough. His mother, Jennie
          Jerome, was the daughter of an American business tycoon, Leonard
          Jerome. <br />

          Winston's childhood was not a particularly happy one. Like many
          Victorian parents, Lord and Lady Randolph Churchill were distant. The
          family Nanny, Mrs Everest, became a surrogate mother to Winston and
          his younger brother, John S Churchill.
        </p>
        <h3>The Soldier</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          After passing out of Sandhurst and gaining his commission in the 4th
          Hussars' in February 1895, Churchill saw his first shots fired in
          anger during a semi-official expedition to Cuba later that year. He
          enjoyed the experience which coincided with his 21st birthday. <br />

          In 1897 Churchill saw more action on the North West Frontier of India,
          fighting against the Pathans. He rode his grey pony along the skirmish
          lines in full view of the enemy. "Foolish perhaps," he told his
          mother, " but I play for high stakes and given an audience there is no
          act too daring and too noble." Churchill wrote about his experiences
          in his first book The Story of the Malakand Field Force (1898). He
          soon became an accomplished war reporter, getting paid large sums for
          stories he sent to the press - something which did not make him
          popular with his senior officers. <br />

          Using his mother's influence, Churchill got himself assigned to
          Kitchener's army in Egypt. While fighting against the Dervishes he
          took part in the last great cavalry charge in English history - at the
          Battle of Omdurman in 1898. <br />

          Churchill had always been determined, as he said, to beat his sword
          into an iron dispatch box. So in 1899 he left the army to stand for
          parliament. He was defeated and almost immediately left for South
          Africa as war correspondent for the Morning Post. Never able to resist
          a fight, he took part in the defence of an armoured train which had
          been ambushed by the Boers. He was captured and treated as a prisoner
          of war, but within a few weeks he escaped and made his way back to
          Durban. Churchill was hailed as a hero and took advantage of his
          status: he always treated advancement as a springboard not a sofa. He
          obtained a military commission from the Commander-in-Chief but
          continued to act as a war correspondent, enjoying many further
          adventures. <br />

          After his successful election to parliament in 1900, Churchill
          continued to trade on his military experiences and eventually became
          First Lord of the Admiralty. But in spirit he always remained a
          dashing cavalry officer and his rashness in attack often got him into
          trouble, notably over the Dardanelles disaster in 1915. As a result he
          resigned from his Cabinet post and joined the Scots Fusiliers who were
          fighting on the Western Front. Once again he enjoyed the experience -
          he actually liked the noise made by the "whiz-bangs". He was a popular
          and efficient officer, as well as a brave one. But his heart was at
          Westminster and in May 1916 he returned to the political fray. <br />
        </p>

        <h3>The Politician</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Churchill was first elected to parliament in 1900 shortly before the
          death of Queen Victoria. He took his seat in the House of Commons as
          the Conservative Member for Oldham in February 1901 and made his
          maiden speech four days later. But after only four years as a
          Conservative he crossed the floor and joined the Liberals, making the
          flamboyant gesture of sitting next to one of the leading radicals,
          David Lloyd George. <br />
          Churchill rose swiftly within the Liberal ranks and became a Cabinet
          Minister in 1908 - President of the Board of Trade. In this capacity
          and as Home Secretary (1910-11) he helped to lay the foundations of
          the post-1945 welfare state. <br />
          His parliamentary career was far from being plain sailing and he made
          a number of spectacular blunders, so much so that he was often accused
          of having genius without judgement. The chief setback of his career
          occurred in 1915 when, as First Lord of the Admiralty, he sent a naval
          force to the Dardanelles in an attempt to knock Turkey out of the war
          and to outflank Germany on a continental scale. The expedition was a
          disaster and it marked the lowest point in Churchill's fortunes.
          <br />
          However, Churchill could not be kept out of power for long and Lloyd
          George, anxious to draw on his talents and to spike his critical guns,
          soon re-appointed him to high office. Their relationship was not
          always a comfortable one, particularly when Churchill tried to involve
          Britain in a crusade against the Bolsheviks in Russia after the Great
          War. <br />
          Between 1922 and 1924 Churchill left the Liberal Party and, after some
          hesitation, rejoined the Conservatives. Anyone could "rat", he
          remarked complacently, but it took a certain ingenuity to "re-rat". To
          his surprise, Churchill was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer by
          Stanley Baldwin, an office in which he served from 1924 to 1929. He
          was an ebullient if increasingly anachronistic figure, returning
          Britain to the Gold Standard and taking an aggressive part in opposing
          the General Strike of 1926. <br />
          After the Tories were defeated in 1929, Churchill fell out with
          Baldwin over the question of giving India further self-government.
          Churchill became more and more isolated in politics and he found the
          experience of perpetual opposition deeply frustrating. He also made
          further blunders, notably by supporting King Edward VIII during the
          abdication crisis of 1936. Largely as a consequence of such errors,
          people did not heed Churchill's dire warnings about the rise of Hitler
          and the hopelessness of the appeasement policy. After the Munich
          crisis, however, Churchill's prophecies were seen to be coming true
          and when war broke out in September 1939 Prime Minister Neville
          Chamberlain appointed him First Lord of the Admiralty. So, nearly
          twenty-five years after he had left the post in pain and sorrow, the
          Navy sent out a signal to the Fleet: "Winston is back". <br />
        </p>
        <h3>The War Leader</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          For the first nine months of the conflict, Churchill proved that he
          was, as Admiral Fisher had once said, "a war man". Chamberlain was
          not. Consequently the failures of the Norwegian Campaign were blamed
          on the pacific Prime Minister rather than the belligerent First Lord,
          and, when Chamberlain resigned after criticisms in the House of
          Commons, Churchill became leader of a coalition government. The date
          was May 10, 1940: it was Churchill's, as well as Britain's, finest
          hour. <br />
          When the German armies conquered France and Britain faced the Blitz,
          Churchill embodied his country's will to resist. His oratory proved an
          inspiration. When asked exactly what Churchill did to win the war,
          Clement Attlee, the Labour leader who served in the coalition
          government, replied: "Talk about it." Churchill talked incessantly, in
          private as well as in public - to the astonishment of his private
          secretary, Jock Colville, he once spent an entire luncheon addressing
          himself exclusively to the marmalade cat. <br />
          Churchill devoted much of his energy to trying to persuade President
          Roosevelt to support him in the war. He wrote the President copious
          letters and established a strong personal relationship with him. And
          he managed to get American help in the Atlantic, where until 1943
          Britain's lifeline to the New World was always under severe threat
          from German U-Boats. <br />
          Despite Churchill's championship of Edward VIII, and despite his habit
          of arriving late for meetings with the neurotically punctual King at
          Buckingham Palace, he achieved good relations with George VI and his
          family. Clementine once said that Winston was the last surviving
          believer in the divine right of kings. <br />
          As Churchill tried to forge an alliance with the United States, Hitler
          made him the gift of another powerful ally - the Soviet Union. Despite
          his intense hatred of the Communists, Churchill had no hesitation in
          sending aid to Russia and defending Stalin in public. "If Hitler
          invaded Hell," he once remarked, "I would at least make a favourable
          reference to the Devil in the House of Commons." <br />
          In December 1941, six months after Hitler had invaded Russia, Japan
          attacked Pearl Harbor. The war had now become a global one. But with
          the might of America on the Allied side there could be no doubt about
          its outcome. Churchill was jubilant, remarking when he heard the news
          of Pearl Harbor: "So we have won after all!" <br />
          However, America's entry into the war also caused Churchill problems;
          as he said, the only thing worse than fighting a war with allies is
          fighting a war without them. At first, despite disasters such as the
          Japanese capture of Singapore early in 1942, Churchill was able to
          influence the Americans. He persuaded Roosevelt to fight Germany
          before Japan, and to follow the British strategy of trying to slit
          open the "soft underbelly" of Europe. This involved the invasions of
          North Africa, Sicily, and Italy - the last of which proved to have a
          very well armoured belly. <br />
          It soon became apparent that Churchill was the littlest of the "Big
          Three". At the Teheran Conference in November, 1943, he said, the
          "poor little English donkey" was squeezed between the great Russian
          bear and the mighty American buffalo, yet only he knew the way home.
          <br />
          In June 1944 the Allies invaded Normandy and the Americans were
          clearly in command. General Eisenhower pushed across Northern Europe
          on a broad front. Germany was crushed between this advance and the
          Russian steamroller. On May 8, 1945 Britain accepted Germany's
          surrender and celebrated Victory in Europe Day. Churchill told a huge
          crowd in Whitehall: "This is your victory." The people shouted: "No,
          it is yours", and Churchill conducted them in the singing of Land of
          Hope and Glory. That evening he broadcast to the nation urging the
          defeat of Japan and paying fulsome homage to the Crown. <br />
          From all over the world Churchill received telegrams of
          congratulations, and he himself was generous with plaudits, writing
          warmly to General de Gaulle whom he regarded as an awkward ally but a
          bastion against French Communism. But although victory was widely
          celebrated throughout Britain, the war in the Far East had a further
          three months to run. The atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
          finally brought the global conflict to a conclusion. But at the
          pinnacle of military victory, Churchill tasted the bitterness of
          political defeat. <br />
        </p>
        <h3>The elder Statesman</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Churchill expected to win the election of 1945. Everything pointed to
          his victory, from the primitive opinion polls to the cartoons in
          newspapers and the adulation Churchill received during the campaign,
          but he did not conduct it well. From the start he accused the Labour
          leaders - his former colleagues - of putting party before country and
          he later said that Socialists could not rule without a political
          police, a Gestapo. As it happened, such gaffes probably made no
          difference. The political tide was running against the Tories and
          towards the party which wholeheartedly favoured a welfare state - the
          reward for war-time sacrifices. But Churchill was shocked by the scale
          of his defeat. When Clementine, who wanted him to retire from
          politics, said that it was perhaps a blessing in disguise, Churchill
          replied that the blessing was certainly very effectively disguised.
          For a time he lapsed into depression, which sympathetic letters from
          friends did little to dispel. <br />
          Soon, however, Churchill re-entered the political arena, taking an
          active part in political life from the opposition benches and
          broadcasting again to the nation after the victory over Japan. In
          defeat Churchill had always been defiant, but in victory he favoured
          magnanimity. Within a couple of years he was calling for a partnership
          between a "spiritually great France and a spiritually great Germany"
          as the basis for the re-creation of "the European family". He was more
          equivocal about Britain's role in his proposed "United States of
          Europe", and, while the embers of the World War II were still warm, he
          announced the start of the Cold War. At Fulton, Missouri, in 1946, he
          pointed to the new threat posed by the Soviet Union and declared that
          an iron curtain had descended across Europe. Only by keeping the
          alliance between the English-speaking peoples strong, he maintained,
          could Communist tyranny be resisted. <br />
          After losing another election in 1950, Churchill gained victory at the
          polls the following year. Publicly he called for "several years of
          quiet steady administration". Privately he declared that his policy
          was "houses, red meat and not getting scuppered". This he achieved.
          But after suffering a stroke and the failure of his last hope of
          arranging a Summit with the Russians, he resigned from the premiership
          in April 1955. <br />
          "I am ready to meet my Maker," Churchill had said on his seventy-fifth
          birthday; "whether my Maker is prepared for the great ordeal of
          meeting me is another matter". Churchill remained a member of
          parliament, though an inactive one, and announced his retirement from
          politics in 1963. This took effect at the general election the
          following year. Churchill died on 24 January 1965 - seventy years to
          the day after the death of his father. He received the greatest state
          funeral given to a commoner since that of the Duke of Wellington. He
          was buried in Bladon churchyard beside his parents and within sight of
          his birthplace, Blenheim Palace. <br />
        </p>
        <h3>The Family Man</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          In the autumn of 1908 Churchill, then a rising Liberal politician,
          married Clementine Hozier, granddaughter of the 10th Earl of Airlie.
          Their marriage was to prove a long and happy one, though there were
          often quarrels - Clementine once threw a dish of spinach at Winston
          (it missed). Clementine was high principled and highly strung; Winston
          was stubborn and ambitious. His work invariably came first, though,
          partly as a reaction against his own upbringing, he was devoted to his
          children.

          <br />
          Winston and Clementine's first child, Diana, was born in 1909. Diana
          was a naughty little girl and continued to cause her parents great
          distress as an adult. In 1932 she married John Bailey, but the
          marriage was unsuccessful and they divorced in 1935. In that year she
          married the Conservative politician, Duncan Sandys, and they had three
          children. That marriage also proved a failure. Diana had several
          nervous breakdowns and in 1963 she committed suicide. <br />
          The Churchills' second child and only son, Randolph, was born in 1911.
          He was exceptionally handsome and rumbustious, and his father was very
          ambitious for him. During the 1930s Randolph stood for parliament
          several times but he failed to get in, being regarded as a political
          maverick. He did serve as Conservative Member of Parliament for
          Preston between 1940 and 1945, and ultimately became an extremely
          successful journalist and began the official biography of his father
          during the 1960s.

          <br />
          Randolph was married twice, first in 1939 to Pamela Digby (later
          Harriman) by whom he had a son, Winston, and secondly in 1948 to June
          Osborne by whom he had a daughter, Arabella. Neither marriage was a
          success.

          <br />
          The life of Sarah, the Churchills' third child, born in 1914, was no
          happier than that of her elder siblings. Amateur dramatics at
          Chartwell led her to take up a career on the stage which flourished
          for a time. Sarah's charm and vitality were also apparent in her
          private life, but her first two marriages proved unsuccessful and she
          was widowed soon after her third. Her first husband was a music hall
          artist called Vic Oliver whom she married against her parents' wishes.
          Her second was Anthony Beauchamp but this marriage did not last and
          after their separation he committed suicide.

          <br />
          In 1918 Clementine Churchill gave birth to a third girl, Marigold. But
          in 1921, shortly after the deaths of both Clementine's brother and
          Winston's mother, Marigold contracted septicaemia whilst on a seaside
          holiday with the childrens' governess. When she died Winston was
          grief-stricken and, as his last private secretary recently disclosed
          in an autobiography, Clementine screamed like an animal undergoing
          torture.

          <br />
          The following September the Churchills' fifth and last child, Mary,
          was born. Unlike her brother and older sisters, Mary was to cause her
          parents no major worries. Indeed she was a constant source of support,
          especially to her mother. In 1947 she married Christopher Soames; who
          was then Assistant Military Attaché in Paris and later had a
          successful parliamentary and diplomatic career. Theirs was to be a
          long and happy marriage. Over the years Christopher became a valued
          confidant and counsellor to his father-in-law. They had five children,
          the eldest of whom (Nicholas) became a prominent member of the
          Conservative party. Christopher Soames died in 1987.
        </p>

        <h3>The Private Man</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Churchill's enormous reserves of energy and his legendary ability to
          exist on very little sleep gave him time to pursue a wide variety of
          interests outside the world of politics. <br />
          Churchill loved gambling and lost what was, for him, a small fortune
          in the great crash of the American stock market in October 1929,
          causing a severe setback to the family finances. But he continued to
          write as a means of maintaining the style of life to which he had
          always been accustomed. Apart from his major works, notably his
          multi-volume histories of the First and Second World Wars and the Life
          of his illustrious ancestor John, first Duke of Marlborough, he poured
          forth speeches and articles for newspapers and magazines. His last big
          book was the History of the English-Speaking Peoples, which he had
          begun in 1938 and which was eventually published in the 1950s. In 1953
          Churchill was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.
          <br />
          Churchill took up painting as an antidote to the anguish he felt over
          the Dardanelles disaster. Painting became a constant solace and
          preoccupation and he rarely spent a few days away from home without
          taking his canvas and brushes. Even during his tour of France's
          Maginot Line in the middle of August 1939 Churchill managed to snatch
          a painting holiday with friends near Dreux.
          <br />
          In the summer of 1922, while on the lookout for a suitable country
          house, Churchill caught sight of a property near Westerham in Kent,
          and fell instantly in love with it. Despite Clementine's initial lack
          of enthusiasm for the dilapidated and neglected house, with its
          overgrown and seemingly unmanageable grounds, Chartwell was to become
          a much-loved family home. Clementine, however, never quite overcame
          her resentment of the fact that Winston had been less than frank with
          her over the buying of Chartwell, and from time to time her feelings
          surfaced.

          <br />
          With typical enthusiasm, Churchill personally undertook many major
          works of construction at Chartwell such as a dam, a swimming pool, the
          building (largely with his own hands) of a red brick wall to surround
          the vegetable garden, and the re-tiling of a cottage at the bottom of
          the garden. In 1946 Churchill bought a farm adjoining Chartwell and
          subsequently derived much pleasure, though little profit, from
          farming.
          <br />
          Churchill was born into the world of hunting, shooting and fishing and
          throughout his life they were to prove spasmodic distractions. But it
          was hunting and polo, first learned as a young cavalry officer in
          India, that he enjoyed most of all.
          <br />
          In the summer of 1949, Churchill embarked on a new venture - he bought
          a racehorse. On the advice of Christopher Soames, he purchased a grey
          three-year-old colt, Colonist II. It was to be the first of several
          thoroughbreds in his small stud. They were registered in Lord
          Randolph's colours - pink with chocolate sleeves and cap. (These have
          been adopted as the colours of Churchill College.) Churchill was made
          a member of the Jockey Club in 1950, and greatly relished the
          distinction.

          Among Winston's closest friends were Professor Lindemann and the "the
          three B's" (none popular with Clementine), Birkenhead, Beaverbook,
          Bracken. The Churchills entertained widely, including among their
          guests Charlie Chaplin, Albert Einstein and Lawrence of Arabia.
          Churchill regularly holidayed with rich friends in the Mediterranean,
          spending several cruises in the late 1950s as the guest of Greek
          millionaire shipowner, Aristotle Onassis.
